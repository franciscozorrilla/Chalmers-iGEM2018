## Overview

Presented in this repository is a framework developed for community dynamic flux balance analysis simulations, COM-dFBA.  This tool can be used to simulate, analyze, and visualize complex microbial communities such as the one found in the human gut. The desired community environment is simulated by generating mass balances around user-defined exchange metabolites of interest, allowing the user to design computational experiments for the analysis of competitive and cooperative interactions between organisms of interest. Additionaly, this repository includes the reconstruction script for generating a draft genome scale model for the probiotic _Saccharomyces boulardii_, an organism of high research interest with no high quality GEM avaialable.

## Citation

This repository makes use of the [RAVEN toolbox](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/). Please follow their installation instructions if any problems arise.
