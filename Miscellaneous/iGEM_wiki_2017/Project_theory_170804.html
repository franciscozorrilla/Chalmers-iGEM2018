           <b>Lung cancer</b> is one of the most common cancer forms today and due to the lack of good 
           detection methods, it is one of the deadliest. A suggested approach for detection of 
           the disease have been to use specific <b>volatile organic compounds</b> (VOCs) that
           have been found in elevated levels in the breath of lung cancer patients. 
         </p>
         <p class=text>
           <b>The aim</b> of this project is to detect two of these VOCs with a biosensor made of <i>Saccharomyces 
           cerevisiae</i>. The VOCs will be detected by <b>G-protein coupled receptors</b> (GPCRs) which will 
           activate the pheromone pathway and initiate mating between a- and α-cells. The output, a 
           colony color change, will be achieved by partially deleting the ADE2 gene with a CRISPR/Cas9 
           system in the fused cell. The colony color change in the biosensor will indicate presence of
           VOCs in the patient’s exhaled breath.

          <b>Lung cancer</b> is the cancer form with the highest death toll, causing <b>1.69 million 
           deaths</b> globally in 2015 [1]. One reason for the high death toll is the late detection 
           of the cancer, due to symptoms starting to appear first in the later stages. 
         </p>
         <p class="text">
           Three different stages are used to characterize lung cancer; I, II and III. The magnitude of 
           the disease is based on size of the tumor and the extent of spreading to lymph nodes 
           and other organs in the body [2]. A majority of the lung cancer cases today are diagnosed 
           in stage III with a <b>5-year survival rate of 5-14%</b>. An earlier detection at stage I or II 
           would increase the figure to <b>45-49%</b> which clearly show that early detection is a key to
           increase the chances of surviving lung cancer [3]. 
           </p>
          <p class="text">
           At the appearance of the first symptoms, 
           a <b>chest X-ray</b> is used today to scan for tumors. The scan can indicate the position and size 
           of the tumors. Despite being a non-invasive procedure, it is accompanied by <b>limitations</b> such 
           as cost, time, expertise and sensitivity required for X-ray examinations. Due to these 
           limitations X-ray is not suitable for mass screening of lung cancer [4]. Therefore, there is 
           a demand for new diagnostic tools with mass screening potential. 
         </p>
         <p class="text"> 
           One of the most promising
           approaches for early diagnosis is the use of <b>volatile organic compounds</b> (VOCs) as biomarkers. 
           Some specific VOCs can be detected in higher concentrations in the breath of lung cancer 
           patients compared to healthy individuals. The cancer cells have an increased oxidative rate 
           that results in oxidative stress products found in the breath of patients. <b>The low concentration</b> 
           of VOCs, pmol/l, has provided a challenge in using this approach for detection and no efficient 
           screening method is yet available [5]. 
         </p>
         <p class="text">
           Studies have shown that there is <b>not only one</b> compound 
           that can be used as a biomarker in the breath of cancer patients [5]. An optimal diagnostic tool 
           would therefore be able to detect multiple VOCs in order to decrease the number of false positive 
           diagnoses. One example of a diagnostic tool is a <b>biosensor</b>, which is a biological-based system 
           that can detect the presence of a target analyte and convert it into a signal. A biosensor can be 
           developed with many different species, antibodies or enzymes. In this case, a yeast-based biosensor 
           is a suitable approach and some of the advantages are the ease of genetic manipulation, as well as 
           the <b>cheap and easy cultivation</b> [6]. 
         </p>
         <p class="text">
           To create this novel, non-invasive diagnostic tool, the budding 
           yeast <b><i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i></b> will be used as a biosensor. The yeast cells will have two xenogeneic 
           olfactory receptors incorporated. These can bind the biomarkers that are present in the breath of 
           lung cancer patients, opening up for the possibility to <b>detect the cancer</b> before any symptoms appears.

           The aim of this project is to detect two VOCs that have been found in elevated 
           levels in the breath of lung cancer patients, using a biosensor made of <i>Saccharomyces 
           cerevisiae</i>. Two of the most commonly found VOCs; butanone and n-octanal, are chosen for 
           detection [7, 8]. The VOCs will be detected by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with the 
           ability to activate the pheromone pathway in yeast and thereby initiate mating between a- and 
           α-cells. The final output will be a color change due to deletion of the ADE2 gene using gRNA 
           and Cas9. The colony color change will indicate the presence of the target VOCs, and thereby 
           also lung cancer.

           Natively, yeast have GPCRs regulating the cell mating through activation of the pheromone
           pathway. These GPCRs, STE2 and STE3, are present respectively in the two different mating 
           types of yeast, a and α. STE2 and STE3 bind pheromones from the other mating type and activate
           the pheromone pathway which enables mating. In our system STE2 and STE3 will be replaced with 
           the GPCRs RatI7 and Olfr1258 which detect the two VOCs butanone and n-octanal respectively [7,8].
           When the GPCRs sense the VOCs, the pheromone pathway will be activated which will result in
           expression of both the native mating genes and cloned Cre recombinase in both cell types. Binding
           of butanone and n-octanal will therefore lead to mating of cells, but solely if both VOCs are present.

           In each mating type, a system will be integrated consisting of a promoter in the wrong direction, 
           surrounded by mutated LoxP sites, followed by genes expressing either gRNAs or Cas9, see Figure 2.
           Presence of the two VOCs will lead to, besides mating, activation of the respective genes since Cre
           recombinase will turn the promoters in to the right direction. The loxP sites are mutated, preventing 
           the sites from inverting back to their original direction. This ensures that the promoter is inverted 
           into the correct direction upon GPCR activation and remains in that position [9].

           For expression of the gRNAs, the promoter pSNR52 will be used. Together with polymerase III,
           the pSNR52 promoter will not translate the  gRNAs into proteins [10]. Two different gRNAs will 
           be expressed by the same promoter and the two gRNAs will be linked together with two ribozymes; 
           HDV and Hammerhead. After expression, the ribozymes will cut themselves out and leave the two gRNAs
           as separate sequences [11]. For the other mating type, the strong constitutive promoter pTEF1 will
           be used to express the Cas9 protein. Since the gRNAs and the Cas9 protein are expressed in cells of 
           different mating types, the lack of combination will will not disrupt the adenine synthesis in haploid cells. 
         </p>

         <p class="text">
          After mating, the gRNAs and Cas9 will both be present in the newly formed diploid cell and assemble into a 
           functional unit. The gRNAs will guide the Cas9 protein to two sites in the ADE2 gene, creating two different
           double strand breaks in the gene. The double stranded breaks will lead to a partial disruption of the ADE2 gene
           and an accumulation of a red intermediate during adenine synthesis [12]. The color shift of the cells from white
           to red will function as a diagnostic response.
